Hello!

The input data file can be modified as you want, but make sure the coordinates are separated by a comma, in the format: 41.5624, 2.0109. When adding the costs do not add the symbol of the currency, just the amount! It is also important that the header,names and distribution are not changed, otherwise the model will not understand the input data.

The python files in this folder open the excel file to read the input data, that can be modified at any time. Reads the file and executes the Gurobi algorithm.There are two
files here that can execute the model if Python and Gurobi are installed. I have used an academic license. 

(1) The .ipynb file: with a notebook viewer, the details and main comments can be seen.It can be seen just by clicking it here in github.

(2) In the executable folder: executable/temp_facilities.py. With python installed, this can 
run easily in the command prompt.

I have added the results of a simulation we did, in the output_temporary_facilities.txt with the data in the input Excel file.

For any doubt, or to see a simulation email me at genona.torruella01@estudiant.upf.edu.

Thank you.
